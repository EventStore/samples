## Your first project with Kurrent Cloud

Welcome to Kurrent Cloud! To get you started, we've created an example application packaged as a set of Docker containers that illustrates the flow of events being appended to streams in KurrentDB.  

After you have completed the following steps, you will have: 



* Familiarized yourself with the Kurrent Cloud UI
* Connected an example application to Kurrent Cloud
* Navigated the KurrentDB Web UI and investigated events appended to streams
* Been provided with resources such as documentation, videos, e-learning, and sample code repositories, to take the next step in your Kurrent Cloud journey  

This example application:



* Uses a simple **Python application** to **connect a client** application to KurrentDB hosted in Kurrent Cloud
* Demonstrates the methods to **append (write) and read** events to/from KurrentDB
* Leverages **persistent and catch-up subscriptions** to receive streaming events
* Introduces security concepts with **SSL/TLS and IP access lists**
* Navigates the **KurrentDB Web UI to find streams and events**
* Works with **projections** to transform events from one form to another

Ready to get started?  Let’s get the demo application working in your newly provisioned Kurrent Cloud environment!


## Pre-requisites: Kurrent Cloud

You must adhere to some Kurrent Cloud requirements to access and use the sample application. Let’s step through them now:



* [Internet connectivity](#heading=h.xt8exc6orhkx) (See: Verifying Connectivity below)
* [Client Connection URL](#heading=h.ujp7k68muxnn)  (See: Accessing your Client URL below)
* Security mode where Mutual TLS (mTLS) is disabled
* The cluster you are using has System and User Projections enabled
    * If you didn't do so initially, please create a new cluster using this option.  (see image below)

    ```
esdb+discover://admin:1e6628e34efe480a9e395acbafa8613c@kurrentdb.cud2g7cgdub7p6skf1dg.cucin94gdub7p6skf0i0.sites.dev.eventstore.cloud:2113
```


5. Save this URL for future steps. 


## Pre-requisites on your laptop



* Install Docker

Docker is a container management platform that runs on virtually any operating system. We use it to distribute a set of images that contain our sample application code. If you do not already have Docker installed, follow the instructions to install it on your machine at [https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)



* Install Docker Compose

Docker Compose is an orchestration plug-in for Docker that allows running a set of Docker Images in a pre-defined way. If you DID NOT install Docker Desktop in the previous step, or you do not already have Docker Desktop or Docker Compose installed on your machine, follow the instructions to install it at [https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

To **verify that Docker and Docker Compose are successfully installed** on your computer, open a command prompt and execute the following commands. You should receive output similar to the following (note your version numbers may differ):


```
tony@TonyBook CloudTutorial % docker -v
Docker version 27.4.0, build bde2b89
tony@TonyBook CloudTutorial % docker-compose -v
Docker Compose version 2.31.0
tony@TonyBook CloudTutorial % 
```


Congratulations!  If you have reached this point, you have successfully set up Kurrent Cloud and your laptop.  You are ready to explore the sample application and start running the code in your environment.  


## Overview of Loans Application



<p id="gdcalert19" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image15.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert20">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/image15.png "image_tooltip")


The sample application will implement a basic loan application processing system. The application is comprised of four components:



1. **Seeder**: The **seeder** or **Loan Request** application injects mock **LoanRequested** events using ShadowTraffic. These events provide all the details one would expect to give to a financial institution when applying for a loan, such as a mortgage, credit card, student loan, etc.
2. **Creditcheck**: The **creditcheck** or **Credit Check **application listens for **LoanRequested** events and performs a mock credit score check. For each loan request, a credit score is appended to the stream as a new **CreditChecked **event.
3. **Decider**: The **decider** or **Loan Decider** application listens for **CreditChecked** events and makes an automated decision about whether to approve or deny the loan based on the credit score (appending **LoanAutomaticallyApproved** and **LoanAutomaticallyDenied** events) or to refer the loan for human review (appending **LoanApprovalNeeded** events).
4. **Underwriter**: The **underwriter** or **Underwriting** application listens for **LoanApprovalNeeded** events and presents a **Read Model** to a human, showing the application details and allowing a manual loan approval or denial. For our example, we will automate this process, randomly choosing an **Approver Name**, and randomly choosing to append a **LoanManuallyApproved** or **LoanManuallyDenied** event.

Now that you have a general understanding of the loan application let’s get the code running on your machine!


## Step 1: Download the Docker Compose file

Download the **Docker Compose YAML** (docker-compose.yaml) file to your computer. Place this in a familiar location, such as your **Documents/CloudTutorial** folder. The file is available in our Samples repository:

[https://github.com/EventStore/samples/blob/main/LoanApplication/docker-compose.yaml](https://github.com/EventStore/samples/blob/main/LoanApplication/docker-compose.yaml)


```
tony@TonyBook CloudTutorial % ls -l
total 8
-rw-r--r--@ 1 tony  staff  1296 29 Jan 11:30 docker-compose.yaml
tony@TonyBook CloudTutorial % 
```



## Step 2: Set the environment variable

The **docker-compose.yaml** file will look for an environment variable that will provide the **Client URL** for your database. You copied and saved this information in a pre-requisite step above.  It should be similar to the following:


```
esdb+discover://admin:1e6628e34efe480a9e395acbafa8613c@kurrentdb.cud2g7cgdub7p6skf1dg.cucin94gdub7p6skf0i0.sites.dev.eventstore.cloud:2113
```


Set the DB_URL environment variable for your platform by entering the following at the command line:



* Mac or Linux: export DB_URL=&lt;Client URL>
* Windows: set DB_URL=&lt;Client URL>

Test that the variable is set correctly:

Mac or Linux: 


```
echo $DB_URL                                                                                                                                            
esdb+discover://admin:1e6628e34efe480a9e395acbafa8613c@kurrentdb.cud2g7cgdub7p6skf1dg.cucin94gdub7p6skf0i0.sites.dev.eventstore.cloud:2113
```


Windows:


```
echo %DB_URL%                                                                                                                                            
esdb+discover://admin:1e6628e34efe480a9e395acbafa8613c@kurrentdb.cud2g7cgdub7p6skf1dg.cucin94gdub7p6skf0i0.sites.dev.eventstore.cloud:2113
```



# Step 3: Execute the Docker Compose file:

Now that you have an environment variable containing the **Client URL**, you can run the Docker Compose file to start the application. On the command line, navigate to the folder where you placed the **docker-compose.yaml** file, and execute the following:


```
docker-compose up
```


At this point, Docker images will download, the services will start, and events will begin flowing through the system:

NOTE: The above output is an example. Your output will vary, but all four processes should be running.


## Step 4: Verify the output in the web UI

Return to the **KurrentDB Web UI** in your web browser. Navigate to the **Stream Browser** tab. Note that streams of **loanRequest-&lt;eventID>** are being created in the **Recently Created Streams** table:



<p id="gdcalert20" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image16.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert21">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/image16.png "image_tooltip")


**Clicking a stream name** shows the events in that stream.



<p id="gdcalert21" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image17.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert22">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/image17.png "image_tooltip")


Clicking **JSON** next to an event displays the complete event information.



<p id="gdcalert22" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image18.png).
