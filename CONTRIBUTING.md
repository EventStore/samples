## Working with Git

`main` is just that: the main branch. Releases are tagged from main. 

We attempt to do our best to ensure that the history is preserved and to do so, we generally ask contributors to squash their commits into a single logical commit.

To contribute to EventStoreDB samples:

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch from the `main` (or release) branch
3. We recommend you use a rebase strategy for feature branches (see more in [Git documentation](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Rebasing)). Please use clear commit messages. Commits should also represent a single unit of change
4. Before sending a PR, please make sure you got the latest source branch from the main repository
5. When ready, create a [Pull Request on GitHub](https://github.com/EventStore/samples/compare)

## Code style

Coding rules are set up in the project files to be automatically applied (e.g. with `.editorconfig` or `.prettierrc.json`). Unless you disabled it manually, it should be automatically applied by your IDE after opening the project. We also recommend turning automatic formatting on saving so all rules are applied.

## Licensing and legal rights

By contributing to EventStoreDB:

1. You assert that the contribution is your original work.
2. You assert that you have the right to assign the copyright for the work.
3. You accept the [License](LICENSE.md).
